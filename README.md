# Electricity-Price-Forecasting-using-Hybrid-Model
## Introduction
In Competitive electricity markets, Electricity price forecasting is very valuable for all participants. Good forecasting plays a very important role in power investment decision and transmission expansion.

## Why Electricity price forecasting is difficult?
1. High volatility
2. High frequency
3. Nonlinearity
4. Mean-reversion
5. Non-stationarity
6. Calendar-effect
7. Price spikes

## Extreme learning machine (ELM)
● Extreme learning machines are feedforward neural networks for
classification, regression and clustering with a single layer or
multiple layers of hidden nodes, where the parameters of hidden
nodes need not be tuned.
<br/>● These hidden nodes can be randomly assigned and never
updated.
<br/>● The output weights of hidden nodes are usually learned in a
single step, which essentially amounts to learning a linear
model.

## Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
● PSO was first intended for simulating social behaviour, as a
stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a
bird flock or fish school.
<br/>● PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions
about the problem being optimized and can search very large
spaces of candidate solutions
### How PSO works?
1. Initially we have set of Candidate solutions (called Particles).
2. These particles are moved around in the search-space
3. Every Particle have three direction to move
<br/>3.1. Its current direction
<br/>3.2. Particle’s best direction
<br/>3.3. Swarm’s best direction

## Time Series
Time Series is a set of observations on the
values that a variable takes at different time.
<br/>Ex.Sales trend, Stock market prices, weather
forecasts etc.
